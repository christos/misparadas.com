Now:

- What to do with Locations that are the end of the Route? (e.g. parada 74)
- Rake task to remove Locations that are not on the website
- Migrate Choices to use location.emt_code and favourite_route_id => line.emt_code / route.direction

Improvements:

- Display a single map if multiple locations are encountered
- Investigate how to integrate GetTimeLines.xml
- Proxy arrival requests using either node.js or sinatra/padrino or metal
- Use header gradient image from sprite (for IE compatiblity)
- Rudimentary tests (cucumber or steak)
- Admin (Choices.count and various EMT statistics)
- Search for "N20", "M1"

- Cache http requests
- Parallelize http request

- Use free GoogleAdWords 44P2-MYM9-QYWL-CF6G-QBL

Done:

✓ Investigate whay various locations are without routes
✓ Investigate lines without routes (e.g. cibeles)
✓ Show introduction paragraph if no search and no choices
✓ Merge Mark's CSS iPhone stylesheet
✓ Rake task to add Route destinations
